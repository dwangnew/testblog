This is my attempt at building a blog from scratch using Rails with what I've learned in Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial and Rails for Zombies.

As of January 28, 2012, I have put my own CSS and Javascript to make the blog truly mine. I am working on user signup/signin and posting/commenting functionalities.

This is deployed on heroku: [here](http://floating-lake-4402.herokuapp.com/)
